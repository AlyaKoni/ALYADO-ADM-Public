Where should I go? What do I need to take with me? An emergency plan will help you Disaster can strike at any time. Luckily, there is Alertswiss, a mobile app developed by the Federal Office for Civil Protection to help you plan for and stay safe in an emergency. With Alertswiss, you receive alerts, warnings and information in real time. So that you always know exactly and immediately what action you need to take, the Alertswiss app sends you push notifications on the incident, including valuable tips and instructions on how best to protect yourself and your family. \n\nThe app also lets you customise the type of information you receive: for example, specifying the cantons that you want to receive notifications for, e.g. cantons where your relatives or friends live. All of these reports will be displayed directly on your smartphone’s homescreen. As well as receiving push notifications for your preferred cantons, you can enable push notifications for your current location. However, you first have to authorise the Alertswiss app to determine your location. Once you have activated the location services, all reports and information for both your current location and your preferred cantons will be displayed directly on your smartphone’s homescreen. \nMaps show simply and clearly which areas are currently affected by the ongoing incident. On the overview screen, you can see which incidents are still ongoing and which ones have since been given the all-clear. \n\nUnder Reports you will find an overview of the latest official incident information released in Switzerland and Liechtenstein. These reports – alerts, warnings and information – are divided into three levels of severity, with alerts being the highest and information the lowest. \n\n- An alert is when the authorities notify the public that they are at immediate risk and order them to follow official instructions on the behaviour they need to adopt. \n- A warning refers to the reporting of either a potential risk to the public or an incident for which the authorities issue the public with recommendations rather than orders on the behaviour they should subsequently adopt. \n- The default level of severity for all other reports is Information.\n\nTake swift and appropriate action should a hazardous situation arise. \nSo, what are you waiting for? Download the Alertswiss app now and be prepared should disaster strike. Stay safe! \n\nNote: \nYour smartphone must have a stable data connection (WLAN or mobile network) to receive the latest push notifications and incident reports. If you are offline, you will only be able to view information that was updated the last time you were online. Once the connection is re-established, the system will update automatically and send you all of the latest push notifications and reports.",

        "description": "Simple. Reliable. Secure. — WhatsApp from Facebook\n\nWhatsApp Messenger is a FREE messaging app available for iPhone and other smartphones. WhatsApp uses your phone\u0027s Internet connection (4G/3G/2G/EDGE or Wi-Fi, as available) to let you message and call friends and family. Switch from SMS to WhatsApp to send and receive messages, calls, photos, videos, documents, and Voice Messages.\n\nWHY USE WHATSAPP:\n\n• NO FEES: WhatsApp uses your phone\u0027s Internet connection (4G/3G/2G/EDGE or Wi-Fi, as available) to let you message and call friends and family, so you don\u0027t have to pay for every message or call.* There are no subscription fees to use WhatsApp.\n\n• MULTIMEDIA: Send and receive photos, videos, documents, and Voice Messages.\n\n• FREE CALLS: Call your friends and family for free with WhatsApp Calling, even if they\u0027re in another country.* WhatsApp calls use your phone\u0027s Internet connection rather than your cellular plan\u0027s voice minutes. (Note: Data charges may apply. Contact your provider for details. Also, you can\u0027t access 911 and other emergency service numbers through WhatsApp).\n\n• GROUP CHAT: Enjoy group chats with your contacts so you can easily stay in touch with your friends or family.\n\n• WHATSAPP WEB: You can also send and receive WhatsApp messages right from your computer\u0027s browser.\n\n• NO INTERNATIONAL CHARGES: There\u0027s no extra charge to send WhatsApp messages internationally. Chat with your friends around the world and avoid international SMS charges.*\n\n• SAY NO TO USERNAMES AND PINS: Why bother having to remember yet another username or PIN? WhatsApp works with your phone number, just like SMS, and integrates seamlessly with your phone\u0027s existing address book.\n\n• ALWAYS LOGGED IN: With WhatsApp, you\u0027re always logged in so you don\u0027t miss messages. No more confusion about whether you\u0027re logged in or logged out.\n\n• QUICKLY CONNECT WITH YOUR CONTACTS: Your address book is used to quickly and easily connect you with your contacts who have WhatsApp so there\u0027s no need to add hard-to-remember usernames.\n\n• OFFLINE MESSAGES: Even if you miss your notifications or turn off your phone, WhatsApp will save your recent messages until the next time you use the app.\n\n• AND MUCH MORE: Share your location, exchange contacts, set custom wallpapers and notification sounds, broadcast messages to multiple contacts at once, and more!\n\n*Data charges may apply. Contact your provider for details.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------- \nWe\u0027re always excited to hear from you! If you have feedback, questions, or concerns, please email us at:\niphone-support@whatsapp.com\n\nor follow us on twitter:\n\nhttp://twitter.com/WhatsApp\n@WhatsApp\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nNote: WhatsApp is a telephony app, so iPod and iPad are not supported devices.",
